This blog serves as my self-rescue guide. I'll write some random notes and update photography works irregularly.  

My [bilibili account](https://space.bilibili.com/413010268).  


##### Why build a blog?  
I need a space to express myself. Since friends around me have rather _wicked senses of humor_, I feel it's better to have a secret garden. But I think it's only a matter of time before it's discovered.  


##### For friends who stumbled in by chance  
Congratulations on discovering a website that's <del>incredibly boring</del> full of fun! All content on this site is the owner's random musings.  


##### Is there anything else?  
I might put some interesting trinkets here in the future, but for now, it's still a blank slate.
